# Tea Cozy 

This is a home page for a tea shop called 'Tea Cozy.' The project was a part of Codecademy's advanced CSS course, whose purpose was to learn to use Flexbox on a simple layout. I followed a design spec that they provided, from which I had to reverse-engineer the layout in CSS. I managed to recreate the spec exactly, but it is not a fully responsive webpage, so it might appear differently on different screens. 

You can find the design spec here: https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg?_gl=1*1uihifa*_ga*MTIyOTM5Mzc1LjE2NzQxMjk0MDA.*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY3NzUwNTk3OS4xNDQuMS4xNjc3NTA2MDM4LjAuMC4w
